# STT-TTS

## Overview

**STT-TTS** is a project focused on providing efficient solutions for Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks. The repository aims to help developers and researchers easily integrate voice interfaces into their applications, enabling both the conversion of spoken language into written text and the generation of natural-sounding speech from text input.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Convert spoken audio input into written text.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Synthesize natural-sounding speech from text input.
- Support for multiple languages (if implemented).
- Modular and extensible design for easy integration.
- Example scripts for basic usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BharatHBaddi0078/STT-TTS.git
cd STT-TTS
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Speech-to-Text

```python
from stt import speech_to_text

audio_path = "path/to/audio.wav"
text = speech_to_text(audio_path)
print("Recognized Text:", text)
```

#### Text-to-Speech

```python
from tts import text_to_speech

text = "Hello, this is a demo of text to speech."
output_path = "output.wav"
text_to_speech(text, output_path)
print(f"Audio saved to {output_path}")
```

> **Note:** The actual module and function names may differ. Please refer to the source code for exact usage.
